Certain types of fire behavior are considered unusual or unexpected only because of the failure to evaluate properly the conditions, influences, and forces that are in control. To predict fire behavior, and to control and use fire effectively and safely, one must understand and use the interactions of fire with its environment. Examines the fire environment: what it is, how it varies and why, and how fire itself alters the total picture.",
