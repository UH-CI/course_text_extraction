It comprises several areas of investigation of critical importance to science and medicine.  Neuropharmacology involves studies aimed at understanding the mechanism by which drugs alter brain function.  These include medications used to treat a wide range of neurologic and psychiatric disorders as well as drugs of abuse. Neuropharmacology uses this information to develop new medications with ever-improving efficacy and safety for diseases of the nervous system.
