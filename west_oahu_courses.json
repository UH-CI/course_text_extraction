Beginning with fifth century BCE Greece and ending with twenty-first century CE United States, the course will survey rhetorical history, observing the ways rhetoric shifted from an art for oral performance to an epistemic lens for understanding and creating meaning. In addition, the course will explore the ways in which language has been used across times and places to create a shared reality, to change reality, and to secure power within that reality. In the process, students will discover the intimate connection between rhetoric and philosophy, rhetoric and community, rhetoric and media, and rhetoric and the real world they occupy.",
