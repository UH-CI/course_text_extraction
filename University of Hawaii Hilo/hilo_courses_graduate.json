Its scope includes the study of the physical, chemical, biochemical and biological properties of drugs, drug substances, or potential drugs or drug substances of natural origin as well as the search for new drugs from natural sources.  This course will focus on chemical aspects of Pharmacognosy.  Natural products are normally classified according to their biosynthetic origins and chemical properties.  Thus, the objective of the course is to familiarize students with an introduction to and classification of natural products (terpenoids, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids and allied phenolic compounds).  The basic metabolic pathways and the origin of secondary metabolites such as the shikimic acid pathways, the acetate-malonate pathway, the mevalonate pathways will be discussed.  It is a core course of Pharmacognosy and enable students to use this knowledge in the future to explore Advanced Pharmacognosy.  A special emphasis will be placed on how chemical structure affects physiological function of various natural products.  Pre:  Approval of Major Professor.",
